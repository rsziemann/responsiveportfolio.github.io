    <p>
      Thank you for coming to my Website. A little bit about me, well as you can
      see from my photo I'm a greyhound. I was recsued by an awesome human 4
      years ago and let me tell you this life of hanging out on the couch and
      going for long walks is so much better than my old life. Oh I almost
      forgot to mention that I used to be a Race dog down in Oklahoma. Lucky for
      me I wasn't very fast and they retired me early. Thats when I met my human
      at a greyhound rescue in philadelphia called NGAP and went to my forever
      home. Since that day four years ago I have lived the life. It is my
      mission now to help other retired race dogs find forever homes.
